# 📅 Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
### 🗓 Day 1 – Objects and Classes  
**Date:** 26 December 2025

On this day, I learned the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** in Java.
I implemented **10 programs** (5 Level 1 + 5 Level 2) using real-world examples.

### 📘 Concepts Learned
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Methods
- Encapsulation
- Real-world problem modeling
- Memory allocation basics

### 🟢 Level 1 Practice Programs
1. Employee Details Program  
2. Area & Circumference of Circle  
3. Book Details Management  
4. Inventory Tracking System  
5. Mobile Phone Details Program  

### 🔵 Level 2 Practice Programs
1. Student Report & Grade Calculator  
2. ATM / Bank Account Simulation  
3. Palindrome String Checker  
4. Movie Ticket Booking System  
5. Shopping Cart Simulation

### 🗓 Day 02 – Constructors, Access Modifiers & OOPS Practice  
**Date:** 27 December 2025

On the second day of training, the focus was on understanding best practices in constructors, access modifiers, and applying OOPS concepts through hands-on practice programs.

#### Practice Programs Implemented

**Level 1 Constructor Practice**
- Book class with default and parameterized constructors.
- Circle class using constructor chaining.
- Person class with a copy constructor.
- Hotel Booking System using default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
- Library Book System with book borrowing functionality.
- Car Rental System with rental cost calculation.

**Instance vs Class Variables and Methods**
- Product Inventory Management system.
- Online Course Management system.
- Vehicle Registration system.

**Access Modifiers Practice**
- University Management System demonstrating public, protected, and private access.
- Book Library System with EBook subclass.
- Bank Account Management using SavingsAccount subclass.
- Employee Records with Manager subclass.

All programs were implemented using standard Java coding conventions and organized using proper package structure.
