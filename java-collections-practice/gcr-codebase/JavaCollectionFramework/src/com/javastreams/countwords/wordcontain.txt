The heavy iron door of the bookstore didn't creak; it sighed.
Elias loved that sound. It was the sound of secrets being kept. He had worked at "The Last Page," a tiny, disorganized shop tucked into the narrowest alley in the city, for thirty years. He knew the scent of every book—a mix of vanilla, dust, and the slow march of time.
It was a rainy Tuesday when she walked in. She was young, perhaps twenty, wearing a bright yellow raincoat that seemed to scream against the muted tones of the shop. She didn't look at the fiction, or the history, but headed straight to the back, to the section marked "Unclassified."
"Can I help you find something?" Elias asked, not looking up from his ledger.
"I’m looking for the book that isn't there," she said.
Elias stopped writing. He finally looked at her. "Most books aren't here, miss. That's how libraries work."
"No," she said, tapping her finger on a bookshelf that was completely empty, save for a thick layer of dust. "The blue book. The one with the silver latch. My grandfather said you were holding it for him."
Elias felt a cold chill despite the warmth of the shop. That shelf was reserved for items that couldn't be sold—items that seemed to move on their own. The blue book had vanished five years ago, on the same day her grandfather, a regular customer, had passed away.
"Your grandfather was a collector of tall tales," Elias said smoothly, returning to his ledger. "That shelf has been empty for years."
"Then why," she asked, pointing, "is the dust disturbed?"
Elias looked. It was true. A straight line ran through the dust, as if a thin object had been removed recently.
"I clean, sometimes," he lied.
"I know it's here, Mr. Elias. He said if I ever needed to remember how to breathe, I should come here." She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, rusty silver key.
Elias looked at the key, then at her eyes—they were the exact shade of grey as her grandfather's. He sighed, a sound that matched the door. He walked to the empty shelf, reached behind the wooden backing, and pulled out a slim, leather-bound volume. It was blue. It had a silver latch.
"He said you’d know what to do," he murmured.
She took the book, smiled, and turned to leave.
"Wait," Elias called out. "What did he mean? 'How to breathe'?"
She looked back from the door, the yellow raincoat a bright beacon in the dim shop. "It’s a story about a dragon who forgot how to fly, so he learned to be a fire-lighter instead. It's about remembering that when you lose one thing, you can start something else."
She walked out into the rain. Elias watched her go, then took his feather duster and carefully brushed the dust back over the empty spot, feeling, for the first time in thirty years, that the shop was not quite as quiet as it used to be.
