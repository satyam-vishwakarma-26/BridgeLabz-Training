## 📅 Week 03 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

### 🗓 Day 1: Linked List (Singly, Doubly & Circular)  
*Date: 2 January 2026*  

#### 🔹 Topics Covered  

*Singly Linked List*
- Understood node structure with data and next reference  

*Doubly Linked List*

*Circular Linked List*
- Implemented circular traversal using `tail.next = head`  

*Algorithmic Thinking*
- Applied traversal-based logic  
- Compared node values and maintained counters  
- Designed efficient solutions using linked list properties
