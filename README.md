## 🗓 Week 7 – Software Design Principles, Patterns and Multithreading 

### Day 1: Introduction to Design Principles  
*Date: 1 February 2026*  

### 🔹 Topics Covered  

*SOLID Principles*
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  

*General Design Principles*
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)  
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)  
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)  

### 🔹 Overview  

Design principles provide guidelines for writing **clean, maintainable, scalable, and extensible** software.  
They reduce tight coupling, improve readability, and simplify future enhancements.

### 🔹 Why Design Principles Matter  

- Improve maintainability and scalability  
- Reduce duplication and complexity  
- Encourage loose coupling and high cohesion  
- Make systems easier to extend and test

### 🗓 Day 2: Introduction to GoF Design Patterns & UML Designing  
*Date: 2 February 2026*  

### 🔹 Topics Covered  

*GoF Design Patterns*
- What are Design Patterns  
- Gang of Four (GoF) Overview  
- Purpose and benefits of Design Patterns  
- Categories of Design Patterns  
  - Creational  
  - Structural  
  - Behavioral  

### 🔹 Design Patterns Studied  

- **Singleton Pattern**  
  - Ensures a single instance  
  - Provides global access  

- **Factory Pattern**  
  - Hides object creation logic  
  - Promotes loose coupling  

- **Observer Pattern**  
  - One-to-many dependency  
  - Automatic state change notification  

- **Builder Pattern**  
  - Separates construction from representation  
  - Useful for complex object creation  

### 🔹 UML Designing  

- Class diagrams for pattern representation  
- Association, inheritance, and dependency relationships  
- Visualizing responsibilities and interactions  

### 🔹 Why Use Design Patterns?  

- Reusable and proven solutions  
- Improves flexibility and maintainability  
- Encourages best design practices  
- Makes systems easier to extend and understand
