###  🧠 Solved Scenario-Based Questions on DSA
#### 🗓 *Date: 10 January 2026*

1. ** BookShelf – Library Organizer (HashMap + Linked List)**

  - In a library system, books are arranged based on genre and author. A HashMap maps genre → list of books (LinkedList). Each list is dynamically updated when books are borrowed or returned.

2. **BrowserBuddy – Tab History Manager (Doubly Linked List + Stack)**

  - Neha is working on a custom browser. Each open tab maintains its browsing history with "Back" and "Forward" operations. She uses a Doubly Linked List for history and a Stack to hold closed tabs for reopening.

3. **AmbulanceRoute – Emergency Patient Navigation (Circular Linked List)**

  - In a hospital, there are multiple buildings connected in a circular fashion: Emergency → Radiology → Surgery → ICU → Emergency. When an ambulance is bringing in patients, it follows a Circular Linked List to decide the nearest available unit for emergency treatment.
