# 📅 Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
### 🗓 Day 1 – Objects and Classes  
**Date:** 26 December 2025

On this day, I learned the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** in Java.
I implemented **10 programs** (5 Level 1 + 5 Level 2) using real-world examples.

### 📘 Concepts Learned
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Methods
- Encapsulation
- Real-world problem modeling
- Memory allocation basics

### 🟢 Level 1 Practice Programs
1. Employee Details Program  
2. Area & Circumference of Circle  
3. Book Details Management  
4. Inventory Tracking System  
5. Mobile Phone Details Program  

### 🔵 Level 2 Practice Programs
1. Student Report & Grade Calculator  
2. ATM / Bank Account Simulation  
3. Palindrome String Checker  
4. Movie Ticket Booking System  
5. Shopping Cart Simulation

### 🗓 Day 02 – Constructors, Access Modifiers & OOPS Practice  
**Date:** 27 December 2025

On the second day of training, the focus was on understanding best practices in constructors, access modifiers, and applying OOPS concepts through hands-on practice programs.

#### Practice Programs Implemented

**Level 1 Constructor Practice**
- Book class with default and parameterized constructors.
- Circle class using constructor chaining.
- Person class with a copy constructor.
- Hotel Booking System using default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
- Library Book System with book borrowing functionality.
- Car Rental System with rental cost calculation.

**Instance vs Class Variables and Methods**
- Product Inventory Management system.
- Online Course Management system.
- Vehicle Registration system.

**Access Modifiers Practice**
- University Management System demonstrating public, protected, and private access.
- Book Library System with EBook subclass.
- Bank Account Management using SavingsAccount subclass.
- Employee Records with Manager subclass.

All programs were implemented using standard Java coding conventions and organized using proper package structure.

### 🗓 Day 3 – Static, Final & Object Behavior  
**Date:** 29 December 2025

On the third day of training, the focus was on understanding important Java keywords and operators that control memory, immutability, and object behavior. Along with theory, multiple real-world practice programs and scenario-based problems were implemented to strengthen practical understanding.

#### Activities Completed
- Learned about core Java keywords and concepts:
  - `static` keyword (class-level variables and methods)
  - `final` keyword (constants, method prevention, and immutability)
  - `instanceof` operator (runtime object type checking)

- Developed practice programs using real-world entities:
  - `BankAccount`
  - `Book`
  - `Library`
  - `Company`
  - `Patient`
  - `Product`
  - `Student`
  - `Vehicle`

- Applied object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, class design, and method usage.
- Practiced writing clean, structured Java programs with proper naming conventions.
- Committed and pushed all completed programs to the remote repository using standard Git practices.

### 🗓 Day 4 – Object Oriented Design & Relationships  
**Date:** 30 December 2025

On the fourth day of training, the focus was on understanding **Object-Oriented Design principles** and modeling real-world systems using **UML diagrams** and **object relationships**. Practical problems were solved to strengthen conceptual clarity and design thinking.

#### Activities Completed
- Learned core **Object Oriented Design Principles**:
  - Class Diagram
  - Object Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram

- Understood and applied object relationships:
  - Association
  - Aggregation
  - Composition

- Solved assisted object-modeling problems:
  - **Library and Books** (Aggregation)
  - **Bank and Account Holders** (Association)
  - **Company and Departments** (Composition)

- Solved self-practice design problems:
  - **School and Students with Courses** (Association and Aggregation)
  - **University with Faculties and Departments** (Composition and Aggregation)
  - **Hospital, Doctors, and Patients** (Association and Communication)
  - **E-commerce Platform with Orders, Customers, and Products**
  - **University Management System**

- Focused on identifying correct relationships between classes based on real-world scenarios.
- Practiced communication between objects using method interactions.
- Improved understanding of system design before implementation.
- Followed clean class structure and naming conventions during problem-solving.
