<h1 align="center">📅 Week 4: Java Collections, Streams</h1>

### 🗓 Day 1 – Java Generics 
*Date: 16 january 2026*

#### 🔹 Topics Covered  

*Java Generics*
- Type safety using generics  
- Generic classes and generic methods  
- Bounded type parameters (`<T extends ...>`)  
- Upper (`? extends T`) and lower (`? super T`) bounded wildcards  
- Avoiding raw types  
- Type erasure awareness  
- Designing clean and reusable generic APIs
  
### ✅ Practice Problems  

Implemented **5 scenario-based systems** using Java Generics:

1. **Smart Warehouse Management System**  
2. **Dynamic Online Marketplace**  
3. **Multi-Level University Course Management System**  
4. **Personalized Meal Plan Generator**  
5. **AI-Driven Resume Screening System**
